World Happiness Report Analysis (2015-2023) - Power BI Dashboard

Pipeline: 

Data Transformation: integrated and normalized data from multiple years due to inconsistencies in column names, missing values, and variations in country and region names. I addressed these challenges by standardizing the data, handling anomalies, and ensuring a consistent format across all datasets.

Interactive Dashboards:

Dashboard 1: Offers a comprehensive overview of the average happiness scores across different years, regions, and countries. It includes insights into the top 10 happiest and saddest countries, with the ability to filter data based on year and region.

Dashboard 2: Delves into the correlations between happiness and various factors such as GDP per capita, health, freedom, family support, generosity, and trust. The visualizations highlight how these elements interact to influence happiness scores globally.
Challenges Overcome: Dealing with missing rankings, discrepancies in region names, and combining data from different sources required meticulous attention to detail and data validation to ensure accuracy and integrity.
